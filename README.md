    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import iterUnitspace from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/iter-unitspace@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### iterUnitspace( start\[, stop] )

Returns an iterator which returns numbers incremented by `1`.

```javascript
var it = iterUnitspace( -5 );
// returns <Object>

var v = it.next().value;
// returns -5

v = it.next().value;
// returns -4

v = it.next().value;
// returns -3

// ...
```

The returned iterator protocol-compliant object has the following properties:

-   **next**: function which returns an iterator protocol-compliant object containing the next iterated value (if one exists) assigned to a `value` property and a `done` property having a `boolean` value indicating whether the iterator is finished.
-   **return**: function which closes an iterator and returns a single (optional) argument in an iterator protocol-compliant object.

By default, the stopping value is `+infinity`, and, hence, the returned iterator is an infinite iterator (i.e., the iterator never ends). To specify an alternative stopping value, provide a second argument.

```javascript
var it = iterUnitspace( 0, 2 );
// returns <Object>

var v = it.next().value;
// returns 0

v = it.next().value;
// returns 1

v = it.next().value;
// returns 2

var bool = it.next().done;
// returns true
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The returned iterator is guaranteed to return the `start` value and stops upon exceeding the `stop` value.
-   If an environment supports `Symbol.iterator`, the returned iterator is iterable.
